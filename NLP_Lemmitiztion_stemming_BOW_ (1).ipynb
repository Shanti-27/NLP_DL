        "# LEMMATIZATION AND STEMMING\n",
        "\n",
        "In natural language processing (NLP), both lemmatization and stemming are techniques used to reduce words to their base or root form. They are employed to normalize text data, improve text analysis, and enhance computational efficiency. While they serve a similar purpose, there are key differences between the two approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lemmatization:\n",
        "Lemmatization aims to reduce words to their base form, known as the lemma. The lemma is the dictionary form or the canonical form of a word. It ensures that different inflected forms of a word are mapped to the same base form. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lemmatization of the word \"running\" would result in \"run.\"\n",
        "Lemmatization of \"better\" would yield \"good.\"\n",
        "Lemmatization considers the context and part of speech (POS) of the word in order to produce the appropriate lemma. For instance, the lemma of \"better\" could be \"good\" as an adjective, but it could also be \"well\" as an adverb.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stemming:\n",
        "Stemming involves reducing words to their stems, which are the core parts of words. It involves removing prefixes or suffixes from words to obtain the base form. The stemming process may produce stems that are not actual words. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Stemming the word \"running\" would result in \"run.\"\n",
        "Stemming \"better\" would produce \"bett.\"\n",
        "Stemming algorithms apply a set of rules or heuristics to perform the reductions. Since stemming relies on rule-based manipulation, it is generally faster than lemmatization. However, it may not always generate linguistically correct stems.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice between lemmatization and stemming depends on the specific NLP task and the desired outcome. Lemmatization is often preferred when maintaining the grammatical integrity of the text is important. It produces meaningful base forms that can be useful for tasks such as language understanding, information retrieval, and topic modeling. Stemming, on the other hand, is suitable for tasks like information retrieval, search engines, and sentiment analysis, where speed and simplicity are prioritized over linguistic accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both techniques are available in popular NLP libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and spaCy, offering various lemmatizers and stemmers for different languages."

        "\n",
        "BoW is a representation of text data where each document is represented as a collection of words, disregarding grammar and word order.\n",
        "It involves creating a vocabulary of unique words from the entire corpus and representing each document as a vector of word frequencies or presence/absence indicators.\n",
        "BoW is a simple and commonly used approach for text classification and information retrieval tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Unigrams, Bigrams, and N-grams:\n",
        "\n",
        "Unigrams refer to individual words in a text.\n",
        "Bigrams are pairs of consecutive words occurring together in a text.\n",
        "N-grams are sequences of N words occurring together in a text.\n",
        "N-grams capture more context and can provide a richer representation of text compared to individual words.\n",

        "# 4. Speech to Text (STT):\n",
        "\n",
        "STT, also known as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is a technology that converts spoken language into written text.\n",
        "It involves analyzing audio recordings and transcribing the spoken words into a textual form.\n",
        "STT systems use techniques like acoustic modeling, language modeling, and decoding algorithms to recognize and convert speech.\n",
        "STT is used in applications like transcription services, voice-controlled systems, voice assistants, and more.\n",

        "Both TTS and STT are important components of natural language understanding and communication systems, enabling interactions between humans and machines through speech and text.\n",
